These are the sample users created by our scripts

Nurses:

Laura test4321
Lauren test123

Admin:

Sam test1234


KNOWN ISSUES:

* The login currently does not differentiate user roles. i.e. Sam, an admin, gets the Nurse dashboard
* User full name is not populated in the NAME field of the dashboard, only the username
* EditPatientUsercontrol does not properly "lock" on logout like the other dashboard modules
* Patient Tab displays only selected Patient once selected, until it loses focus, then displays all patients again when returning
