These are the sample users created by our scripts

Nurses:

Laura test4321
Lauren test123


Admin:

Sam test1234


KNOWN ISSUES:

* The login currently does not differentiate user roles. i.e. Sam, an admin, gets the Nurse dashboard
* User full name is not populated in the NAME field of the dashboard, only the username
* EditPatientUsercontrol does not properly "lock" on logout like the other dashboards
